DriftX Store Development Timeline
Project Brief
DriftX Store is a modern and scalable e-commerce platform designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for users while showcasing full-stack development skills. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the project includes user authentication, secure payments, an AI-powered recommendation system, and an intuitive admin dashboard for product and order management.
This capstone project will cover key full-stack concepts, from API development to frontend UI, ensuring a complete demonstration of software product engineering skills. The goal is to make DriftX Store a functional and scalable platform that can be extended with additional features over time.
